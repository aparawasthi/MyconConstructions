                <h2>New Build Homes</h2>
                <p>We can provide a turnkey package to construct a new build home. We are happy working closely with
                    clients and architects to form a robust, well-informed team to move the project forwards with no
                    surprises.</p>

                <h2>House Extensions</h2>
                <p>Extending your home can often be a less costly and stressful option than moving to a new property.
                    You can take the opportunity to change the layout and make the building to work better for you.</p>
                <p>We will guide you every step of the way with your house extension. If required we know some great
                    Architects who can help design the space, apply for planning permission and produce detailed plans.

                <h2>House Renovation</h2>
                <p>House renovation projects breath new life into tired homes. We have significant experience working
                    with listed buildings and ones within Heritage and Conservation areas. We use building techniques
                    that are sympathetic to the building.</p>
                <p>You can update the layout to create better spaces. Make structural changes or perhaps just modernise
                    what already exists. There are endless possibilities for completely changing the look, function and
                    feel of your house renovation project.</p>

                <h2>Property Development</h2>
                <p>We are actively seeking properties with development potential. Also, land which may pose the
                    opportunity for new build projects. Particularly we are looking for projects in the Kanpur and
                    nearby areas. We will also consider opportunities that are further afield.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to produce unique and interesting properties built with care. If you have a property or
                    land you would like to discuss then please get in touch.</p>

                <h2>Landscaping & External Works</h2>
                <p>Hard landscaping projects create an interesting outside area to your property and will add to its
                    value. You can include Paved Areas, Bound Aggregate Paths with Timber, Concrete or Brick Edging,
                    Rock & Stone Features, Pergolas & Shelters, Ponds & Water Features. Additionally driveways and paths
                    in a multitude of finishes, all carefully built to a high standard.</p>

                    commercial premises, complete construction of small industrial units, change of use on commercial
